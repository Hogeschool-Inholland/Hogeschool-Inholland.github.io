                    <header>The focus on aerodynamics is shifting</header>
                    <p>Formula One invests more in aerodynamics than any other sport in the world: in theory, a Formula
                        One car’s downforce is so strong you could drive it upside down along the roof of a tunnel
                        without falling off!</p>
                    <p>This year’s aero packages have seen the biggest shake-up in decades, with a shift to ground
                        effect – suction under the car – which is something that’s been abandoned in favour of airflow
                        over the car’s body since 1982. There are also major changes to how cars affect the aerodynamics
                        of their rivals, as just a glance at the 2022 car’s new, stylishly curved rear wings will tell
                        you.
                    </p>
                    <p>But did you know you use the same aerodynamics that keep these incredible cars on the road every
                        time you buy your lunch at the supermarket? One of the largest costs – both in terms of energy
                        bills and carbon footprint – for supermarkets comes from their open freezer units, as the
                        shelves cause the cold air to spill out.</p>

                    <header>Fuel is going green</header>
                    <p>A Formula One engine is an apex predator of the motorworld, with cylinders seeing 50,000 mini-explosions during the course of a lap to drive its pistons, and inside temperatures reaching 2,750°C. But the stuff that’s flowing into the engine is changing this year.</p>
                    <p>From 2022, Formula One will run on E10 fuel, meaning 10 per cent of the mix is made from ethanol, produced from plants. This is a move to improve the sport’s eco-credentials, albeit at a slight loss of horsepower. This petrol-biofuel mix is likely to stay until 2025, but F1 experts are already looking at how the cars will be powered in the future. Rival set-up Formula E has an exclusive licence on electric racing, so teams will have to move to another green option in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>The leading candidates are hydrogen power – already, teams are looking at using it to race at the 24 Hours of Le Mans – or synthetic fuels, which uses chemical processes, often powered by renewable energy, instead of crude oil to create petrol.</p>

                    <header>Sporting secrets are being revealed</header>
                    <p>Formula One is the ultimate engineer sport, with the fastest car usually trumping the fastest driver. Unsurprisingly, teams spend millions on hiring the best minds in the world to think up clever tricks and tactics that can give them the edge – but this year the playing field is being levelled.</p>
                    <p>There are now mandatory ‘show and tell’ technical sessions, where teams have to explain how they’ve modified their car. In theory, that should stop anyone from gaining a serious advantage through a clever piece of technology – such as the famous Brawn ‘double diffuser’ in 2009, or even stranger changes, such as the 1978 Brabham BT46 ‘fan car’, or Tyrell’s six-wheeled entry from 1976.
                    </p>
                    <p>Even though clever changes are often banned, they can still benefit us in surprising ways. In the late 2000s, Williams developed a Kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) using its brakes to power a spinning flywheel that could store energy. Although this has been replaced by other methods in racing, the flywheel idea is used by London buses to make them more efficient. And in 2005 and 2006, Fernando Alonso won back-to-back titles thanks in part to his car’s hidden tuned mass damper – the same principle used by skyscrapers to withstand earthquakes and hurricanes.</p>
